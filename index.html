    <h1>Welcome To My Basic Website Exercise</h1>
    <p>This is the first exercise of this course and my first time making a website like this, it's pretty exciting!</p>
    <h1>Who Is This Guy?</h1>
    <p>My name is Daemon, I enjoy playing around with computers and I love corgis!</p>
    <h2>Ok, But What's Your Deal?</h2>
    <p> This is my first time writing in HTML code, I had worked with java code in the Processing 3 application in a high school class. Though I didn't learn too much, I got the basics and enjoyed it.    <br>I took this course because I want to learn something new. I'd like to expand my understanding overall so I can help other people understand a wide range of different computing concepts.   <br>Besides, wouldn't making a website be fun?</p>
